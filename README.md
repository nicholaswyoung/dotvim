# .vim 

Handy files that make getting started with Vim easy. I'll be improving this as I go, but this configuration is the bare minimum for productive Vim usage, as I see it.

## Setup

All third-party plugins are managed with [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). You'll need to install it before proceeding.
